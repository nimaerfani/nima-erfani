            <p>
              I graduated from UVic in summer of 2020 with a Bachelor of
              Software Engineering degree. Throughout my time at UVic, I've had
              a broad range of experiences in software, working with different
              languages, systems, tools and people. I used low-level languages
              like C, and high-level languages like Python. I learned about
              different tools used by developers in the real world, like Git.
              Most importantly, I got to experience software in the real world
              while on co-op. At Stemcell I had the chace to experience every
              step of the software development lifecycle in developing their
              department's shipping application. In contrast, I experienced the
              operations side of an advanced software system in my role at
              Fraser Health where I was supporting an Electronic Medical Records
              system. Excited to see where this journey leads!
